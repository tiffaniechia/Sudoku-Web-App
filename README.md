##Soduku Web Application

The goal of this app is to practice working with Sinatra and Heroku. The app is built on a Soduku solver which is then capable of checking for solutions based on user input.

New Relic was used to record traffic on the site. 

The app is availble on Heroku, you can play the game [here](http://exasperated-sudoku.herokuapp.com/)

##Stack:
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Heroku

##Moving forward: 
It would be great to implement a feature whereby users are able to select the level of difficulty they want. 

A button to view the full solution would be desirable as well.
